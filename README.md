# Installation
There are two ways to obtain Registro in your computer:
1. By compiling it from the source;
2. By downloading the executable file/installer;

## Compiling it from source
_We assume that you have `CMake`, `Qt`, `git` and a `C++` compiler installed in your computer._

Clone the git repository: `git clone https://github.com/ice-bit/registro.git`  
Inside the directory run: `mkdir build && cd build`  
And then: `cmake .. && make`  

After that, the _Makefile_ will create a executable file called **registro**, you can move it anywhere.

## Downloading the executable file
The other way is to download the [executable file](https://github.com/ice-bit/registro/releases) and open/install it.

**Note**: This will only work in _Windows_ and _GNU/Linux_ platforms, official executable file for _OSX_ is not provided yet.

# Usage
Registro is user-friendly and very intuitive, to start it just _double-click_ in the Application icon or start it from a command line interface by typing: `./registro`.

# License
Registro is released under GPLv3.0, you will obtain a copy of this license by downloading the repository or by visiting [this](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) page.
